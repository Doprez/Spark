# Spark
C# Game Engine

Totally raw and unfiltered.
A lot of code files aren't even used - need to clean up.

Some highlights:
- customizable render pipeline
- agressive use of instancing
- Unity-esque components and script execution
- Icoseptree spatialization for culling and shape queries
- Unity-esque customizable editor 
- Editor UI created with Squid - probably the best example for complex UIs
